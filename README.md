## LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/multi_button/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

A push-button or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal. The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often biased switches, although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a spring to return to their un-pushed state.

LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON is a full-featured driver of button launched by LibDriver. It provides multi-button or matrix button press, release,  single click, double click , triple click, repeat click, short press, long press and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON supports multi-button and matrix button, and if you use single button, you can use a more efficient detection method. 

Single button driver can refer to [https://github.com/libdriver/button](https://github.com/libdriver/button).

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON source files.

/interface includes LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON GPIO platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver MULTI_BUTTON offline document.

/datasheet includes MULTI_BUTTON datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface GPIO platform independent template and finish your platform GPIO driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.
